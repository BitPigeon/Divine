# Contributing

Thank you for considering adding to this project. What would we do without people like you?

## Instructions for Contributing

Not sure where to start? That's okay, everyone has to start somewhere. If you have found a bug or want to suggest a feature, feel free to proceed to the issues page [here](https://github.com/BitPigeon/Divine/issues), but first check out the [creating an issue guide](#creating-an-issue).

If you don't have a bug or feature request, please do not create an issue, the issue tracker is only for bugs and feature requests, instead please create a new [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/Divine) question. The community at Stack Overflow will help you with your problem, and if you ask a good question, other users will be able to use if as a valid resource for help.

## Creating an Issue

Found a bug? Have a feature request? If so, I want to hear about it! However, please follow these guidelines when creating your issue. If you want your issue to be fixed or your feature to be added, you must properly format your issue.

## First...

Before you create an issue, please check to see if there is a duplicate, if so, please do not create another issue.

### Bug Reports

Found a bug? I want to do my best to try to fix it! Follow these guidelines to write a good bug report.

- __Version being used__: If you are experiencing a bug, the version you are using is absolutely a valid factor to getting your bug fixed.
- __Your operating system__: Sometimes, projects can work differently on different platforms. That being said, make sure you include your operating system.
- __Steps for reproduction__: If you want to get a bug fixed, you must provide the steps for reproducing the bug, so it can be testing while solving your issue.
- __What you expected and what happened__: What did you expect to happen? What really happened?
- __Description of what you saw or images__: Remember, the person fixing your bug cannot see through your eyes, and needs to understand what happened. So, alway include a very detailed description or images of what happened.
- __What triggered the bug__: Provide pieces of your code.

Some of these guidelines cannot apply to all bug reports. However, please do your best to provide all the necessary details to get the bug fixed.

## Feature Requests

Want a new feature to be added to this project? No problem, as long as you write a good request. Here's what needs to be included.

- __The feature itself__: What are your suggestions?
- __Description of the feature__: Give a detailed description of your feature.
- __Why your feature should be considered__: Why do you think your feature would be good to add to this project?

These are just the bare minimum of the details that need to be included. Your feature is even more likely to be implemented if you include more details.
